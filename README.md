# Simple flask blog app created with the help of youtube tutorial
This is the first ever full app i have created via youtube tutorial. It's mainly focused on the basics of Flask and html. 
It helped me understand the basics of backend web developement, mainly how to set up a route, create a form and integrate backend functionality in frontend via jinja2.
This project also integrates a simple database via SQLite, which stores signed in used, lets them add, edit and delete posts.
This was truly an introduction to web developement and helped me build my next and bigger flask project, which is a fully functional shop based on flask backend.
